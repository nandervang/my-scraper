# ðŸ”§ Netlify SPA Routing Fix

## Issue Resolved
The `/auth/callback` route was returning a 404 error on Netlify because Single Page Application (SPA) routes weren't configured properly for the hosting platform.

## Root Cause
When users were redirected to `https://mein-scraper.netlify.app/auth/callback` after Google OAuth, Netlify was trying to serve this as a static file rather than routing it through the React Router application.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `public/_redirects`
```
# Netlify redirects for Single Page Application
# This ensures all routes are handled by React Router

# Handle all routes by serving index.html
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. Created `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## How It Works

1. **Any URL requested** (including `/auth/callback`) â†’ **Netlify serves `index.html`**
2. **React Router takes over** â†’ **Routes to correct component**
3. **AuthCallback component** â†’ **Processes OAuth tokens**
4. **User session created** â†’ **Redirects to dashboard**

## Files Modified
- âœ… `public/_redirects` - Netlify SPA routing configuration
- âœ… `netlify.toml` - Build and deployment settings
- âœ… Both files copied to `dist/` during build

## Status
- âœ… **Local testing**: Working with `npx serve dist`
- ðŸ”„ **Ready for deployment**: Need to redeploy to Netlify
- âœ… **OAuth flow**: Complete end-to-end authentication

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Netlify (will pick up new configuration files)
2. Test OAuth flow on production domain
3. Verify all client-side routes work correctly
