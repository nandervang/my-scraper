## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Web Scraping Blocking**: Implement rotating proxies and respectful scraping patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Design adaptive rate limiting based on website responses
- **Data Quality**: Implement validation and anomaly detection for scraped data
- **Scalability**: Use queue systems for scraping jobs and implement horizontal scaling

### Business Risks
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure robot.txt compliance and respect website terms of service
- **Data Privacy**: Implement GDPR-compliant data handling and user consent
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize for Core Web Vitals and user experience
- **Reliability**: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Daily active users, session duration
- **Data Quality**: Scraping success rate, data accuracy percentage  
- **Performance**: Page load times, API response times
- **Reliability**: Uptime percentage, error rates
- **API Usage**: n8n integration adoption, webhook delivery success rate
